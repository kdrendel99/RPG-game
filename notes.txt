Things I've currently changed to try and get rattle() to work:
1) commented out the working code, simplified it (so that the buttons aren't up to chance; it saves time clicking)
2)added the rattleDiv around the entire enemy box in index.html for testing
3)changed the getMonsterStats method to append to the html instead of returning a list 
4) swapped (in the test code) all the 'refreshMonsterStats' with 'getMonsterStats'.






changed my mind about these below lol
3) changed form group (under header in index.html) visibility in styles.css so i dont have to enter a name and submit every time i refresh for testing
4) hard-coded the player name in main.js to 'Paul' so it doesn't throw compiler error for the change I made (see '3)', directly above).
